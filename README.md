# RingFitAdventure-MarioKart-Mod
Play Mairo Kart 8 using the Ring Fit Adventure Mod! Tired of losing to blue shells? Now you can actually be tired losing in Mario kart with this mod. The idea is pretty simple: Jog/Run IRL to drive in-game. As simple as it does sound, I haven't had a workout this hard and fun since the gym. Jogging on-and-off for an hour dodging items is a pretty good workout. If you end up using the mod for YouTube, Twitch, etc, all I ask is to be credited, don't be a jerk about it (seriously, don't make me put this stuff behind a different licences and patreon).

## Overall Design of the Mod
As mentioned earlier it's a very simple idea. Jogging presses the acceleration button so when you have to move IRL to go foward in-game. No other buttons are locked behind exercising like my other Ring Fit Mods. You also DO NOT NEED the ringcon, however it does make things easier:
- Jogging acclerates kart
- "Jumping" will give you a boost off ramps
- Leg-strap joycon is disabled 
- In-hand Joycon's face buttons and joystick are not affected by the mod

### Hardware Needed
This mod does require additional hardware to get running. I have a tutorial for how to set it up this mod on <https://www.controllerbend.com/mariokart-ring-fit.html>
- [Titan Two Input Converter](https://www.consoletuner.com/titan-two-factory-direct/)
- RingCon and Legstrap (not needed but helps)
- [Titan Two Wireless Expansion Kit](https://www.consoletuner.com/titan-two-factory-direct/)

### Software Needed
To interact with the Titan Two, you'll need to download Gtuner IV. "Gtuner IV is the main software for programming, updating and configuring the Titan Two device, featuring an complete IDE with integrated compiler for the GPC script language. Gtuner IV also provides user friendly interfaces for easy download, configure and use gamepacks or user made scripts. Based in a modern framework, Gtuner IV supports multi-platform, high resolution monitors and localization" - ConsoleTuner's site. 
- Download the software here: <https://www.consoletuner.com/titan-two-downloads/>
- Make sure to read over how the hardware/software works on the website. <https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:gpc_language_reference> Message me if it still doesn't make sense but if I can figure it out you'll be fine!

### How to Set-up the Mod
I have an old video that shows a how to set-up the mod. It will be updated for the current mod on the <https://www.controllerbend.com/ringfitbotw.html> site once it's ready. YouTube Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYn3pWXMPF8>
1. Connect your Titan Two from the OUTPUT port to your Switch via a Micro USB A cable.
2. Connect your Titan Two from the PROG port to your PC via a Micro USB A cable.
3. Open up the Gtuner IV software
4. Load the MarioKart_RunToDrive.gpc file to the Gtuner IV GPC Script IDE
5. Connect your joycons to the Titan Two via the Device Configuration tab on the right side of the UI. (Use the "Wireless Bluetooth Pairing" button after activating the Joy-Cons' Sync Button")
6. Turn on your Nintendo Switch and launch Mario Kart 8
7. Press the Green "Test and debug" Arrow on Menu file
8. Workout to your heart's content!

### Use without a PC

While the adapter is connected to the PC, and after debugging the script, it can be installed to an available memory slot on the Titan Two to be used without a computer connected to the PROG port. Once the script is installed, it can be removed from the PC, then power the Titan Two by plugging from OUTPUT to the Switch, and use the physical buttons to select the memory slot number.

### FAQ
- Q: Do I need the Wireless Expansion Kit?
- A: Yes, you can't connect to your Joycons without it

- Q: What is it like playing Mario Kart with this mod?
- A: Tiring, I made a couple of videos earlier this year. Here's just general gamemplay <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNZSfunw85A> and here's a speedrun attempt <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwtBlwGSZJI>

- Q: I'm having issues settings things up, what am I doing wrong?
- A: Shoot me a message on twitter on <https://twitter.com/SuperLouis_64>, the Titan Two is hard to set up the fist time.

- Q: This is a bit expensive, is there a cheaper option?
- A: At the moment no. Someone has figured out a way to connect the ringcon to PC but until that's public this is the only way I know of. I have started an Arduino project that will be my version of the Ring Fit Adventure Mod
